STSM project: In this project, we propose to study the extent to which alternative data (News/reports) can predict electricity spot prices. This will allow us to assess the backtesting of relevant investment strategies. The results of this project will also be used to extend an ongoing research project where we study electricity spot price prediction based only on conventional data. We aim to augment the conventional data set with a new feature which reflects the alternative data, and then run the newly augmented dataset through the same neural network model and then compute the new loss function results in order to assess the models’ performance with and without alternative data.

STSM project: Being part of the working group 2 - Transparent versus Black Box Decision-Support Models in the Financial Industry
[8]
, we will investigate the tradeoff between explainability and predictive performance of different black-box models as they apply to financial problem sets, primarily in risk management-credit risk. Specifically, we will study the elements that must be evaluated for a black-box model to be considered interpretable and explainable to take advantage of its predictive potential.

STSM title: Genetic Programming for the Fraudulent Activity Detection: Performance and Transparenct Perspectives.
Host institution: University of Zagreb, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing (FER), Croatia.
Supervisor at FER, Croatia:
Prof. Dr. Domagoj Jakobovic
, Full professor
[10]
Start date:  2021-01-11
End date:  2021-01-26
STSM project: In this project,  we will explore available datasets for fraudulent behavior classification and evaluate their common characteristics. Based on it, we will start a series of experiments with techniques from the machine learning domain and genetic programming to compare their performance. Finally, we will investigate what are the transparency considerations when using genetic programming and what kind of interpretability/explainability one can hope to achieve with such techniques.

STSM project: Shocks in financial markets often lead to severe contagion effects, especially in strongly correlated and highly capitalised markets these effects can be observed almost immediately. A large branch of literature has already focused on the phenomenon of financial contagion. However, the recent availability of high frequency data gives new possibilities to investigate it. A gap in the literature exists regarding the effects of financial contagion in correlated assets w.r.t. high frequency data. The newly emerging cryptocurrency market is highly capitalised, yet it differs from traditional markets due to non-stop trading, lower volume and high correlation among currencies. These properties cause larger volatility and make cryptocurrencies more vulnerable to contagion effects. We analyse a diverse tick cryptocurrency tick dataset and test for jumps following Lee & Mykland (2012), and then aim to model cryptocurrencies as a network of interconnected assets. We want to show that patterns in contagion dynamics exist and that they can be used to predict how future shocks evolve. Eventually, this model aims at helping to understand the dynamics of this new and largely unregulated asset class better. The non-parametric nature makes it also adaptable to applications in traditional assets, thus our goal is to provide a general framework for modeling the dynamics in correlated financial time series with jumps in high frequency.
