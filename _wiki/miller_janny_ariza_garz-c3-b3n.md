.
Host institution: ZHAW School of Engineering, Winterthur, Switzerland.
Home institution: Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Madrid, ES.
STSM title: Fintech and Artificial Intelligence in Finance - Towards a transparent financial industry (FinAI).
We will investigate the tradeoff between explainability and predictive performance of different black-box models as they apply to financial problem sets, primarily in risk management-credit risk. Specifically, we will study the elements that must be evaluated for a black-box model to be considered interpretable and explainable to take advantage of its predictive potential.
