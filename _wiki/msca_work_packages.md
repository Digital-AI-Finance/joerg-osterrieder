WP9 Ethics Requirements
Lead Benificiary: University of Twente.
Researchers involved:
See link
Active period: From M1 to M48.
Activity type: Ethics.
Early Stage Researchers involved: All 1-17.
Description
This project should include an Ethics Mentor for the following reason:
The proposal intends to analyze financial transaction data of persons by doctoral students. Because of the typical detail of such data and the time frame encompassed it is not possible to effectively anonymize this data. Hence it needs to be assumed that the data is pseudonymous data which is considered as personal data according to the GDPR. In this context explainable AI (XAI) is going to be investigated which allows insights in the decisions of the classifier and needs to be ethically reflected. The proposal states that the aim is "explainable and fair AI-generated decision". The consortium shows some awareness by mentioning a potential member of the advisory board with expertise in this area but in the context of the training measurements these subjects are only briefly sketched. Also in the expertise of the scientific advisors these subjects are not substantially present.
The Ethics Mentor should train participants on the ethical dimensions including privacy, fairness and trust in the context of financial data and the intended financial data space. This training should be given to participants at the latest in month 12. In the training concerning XAI (M12) in addition an ethical reflection needs to be introduced. Also in the training course concerning sustainable finance (M18) a critical reflection of the application of XAI and blockchain should be introduced.
For the doctoral students the Ethics Mentor should provide reflection of the ethical dimensions of the individual research projects.
These measurements needs to be documented in a report at month 24 and another report at the end of the project.
Deliverables
D9.1. Appointment of Ethics Advisor (Due in M6)
D9.2. First report of the ethics advisor (Due in M24)
D9.3. Second report of the ethics advisor (Due in M48)
