Machine Learning NeEDS Mathematical Optimization

Weekly Online Seminar Series “Machine Larning NeEDS Mathematical Optimization”
This is a weekly seminar series that will take place every Monday, at 16.30 (CET). It will be 100% online-access, and it will have speakers from around the globe. We have lined up a number of presentations from leading academics in the field of Data Science and Analytics that will cover important topics such as explainability, fairness, fraud, privacy, transparency, etc. Mathematical Modeling and Mathematical Optimization will be at the core of their presentations. We will also have presentations from junior academics showing their latest results in this burgeoning area.
